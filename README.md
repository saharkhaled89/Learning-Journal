##### _The **command line** is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting **A command line**, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text_

![terminal](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSRUSubq7Qie1FN8lzac5euoPEBQ_v41QizH3PyD_LtQc9O9gakyw&s)

**The example of terminal**

1.ls -l /home/ryan

2.total 3

3.drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin

4.drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents

5.drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html

_**Line 1** presents us with a prompt ( user@bash ). After that we entered a command ( ls ). Typically a command is always the first thing you type. After that we have what are referred to as command line arguments ( -l /home/ryan ). Important to note, these are separated by spaces (there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument also). The first command line argument ( -l ) is also referred to as an option. Options are typically used to modify the behaviour of the command. Options are usually listed before other arguments and typically start with a dash ( - )_

_**Lines 2 - 5** are output from running the command. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error_
