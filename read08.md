# Comparison and logical operators

**you can evaluate by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be the  result will be aboolean
true or false**

* (==) is equal to : this operator compares two values (number, strings,or booleans) to see if they 
are the same
 
 'hello' == 'goodbye' thats fales because not the same string but 'Hello' == 'Hello that true because 
 the same string
 
 * != is not equal to : this operator compares two values to see if they aree not the same
 
 * ===strict equal to : this operator compaares two values to check that both the data type and value are 
 the same '3' === 3 returns fales because they are not the sam data type or value
 
 * !== strict not equal to: this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value a
 are not sam
 
 *  > greater than
 * < less than 
 
 # logical operators
 
 comparision operators usualy return single value of true or false that allow you to compare 
 the result of more  than one comparison operator && 
 
 
 USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS 
 
 Here you can see that an if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
 
 1. one set if the condition evaluates to true 
 
 2. another set if the condition is false In 
 
 ### **Loops**
 
 loops check acondition if returns true acode block will run the condition checked again and 
 if it still return true the code run again 
 
 USING WHILE LOOPS
 
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another
if it is false. 
* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
