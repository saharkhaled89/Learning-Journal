# how make js makes web pages more interactive

java script allow you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content 
and markup used in aweb page  while being viewed in the browers

ACCESS CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example: 
• Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page 
• Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i 1

MODIFY CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: 
• Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element and Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those 
also Change the size or position of an <i mg> el

PROGRAM RULES 
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. 
For example: 
• A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments. 
• An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area
(also known as the viewport). 

REACT TO EVENTS 
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

WRITING A SCRIPT 
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it

**Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps**

### **RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES**

* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 

* The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-)
or a period (.) in a variable name

* You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare
a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript. 
ONLINE 

* All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables
that have the same name using different cases

* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store 
a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their
age

#### ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values

#### EXPRESSIONS

**An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions**

* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator 
(the equals sign). 

var color = 'beige'; 

* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 
You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2; 

**A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.**

**Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation
using that value**

**Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.** 

**Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.**

**JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),** 

**strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).**

**Expressions evaluate into a single value.**

**Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value**
